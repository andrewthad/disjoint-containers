# disjoint-containers

`disjoint-containers` has two new data structures: `DisjointSet` and `DisjointMap`

`DisjointSet`:

Disjoint-sets are a set of elements 
with equivalence relations defined between elements, i.e. 
two elements may be members of the same equivalence set.

`DisjointMap`:

Maps with disjoint sets as the key.
